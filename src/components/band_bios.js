All through High School she played Trumpet and maintained first chair trumpet for years as well as being part of All State Choir.

            <strong>Mike Dudley</strong> - Bass Guitar
        </p>
        <p className='bio-text'>
        As the latest addition to the band in 2012, Mike is a jack of trades and a master of all of them. Although he plays bass for the group, he is able to fill in as a drummer or mandolin player. Other then laying down a groove you might see him stagediving, smashing guitars, and biting the heads of small animals on stage.

            <strong>Sam Gillet</strong> - Drums, Cymbals, & Waffle Pan
        </p>
        <p className='bio-text'>
        Hailing from the mean streets of east Belgium, Sam learned early on how to scrap for his next waffle and knows first hand  just how vital caramelized pearl sugar is to the taste of a true Li√®ge-style gaufre.  In the rare moments when he isn't contemplating waffle batter, Sam is practicing for his next drum solo with the tourists.  His secret weapon of choice during live shows is a stainless steel food service pan he uses as a cowbell.
